user_question = ("Based on the information provided, explain the dynamics occurring in the market for Indian workers \
                 in outsourcing jobs as described in a 2004 New York Times report. The report highlighted concerns \
                 about India potentially losing its outsourcing advantage due to rising wages and projected that, \
                 if the country continued producing college graduates at the current rate, demand for workers in \
                 key outsourcing sectors would exceed supply by 20% by 2008.\
                 Specifically, analyze the following:\
                 Is the demand for Indian workers increasing or decreasing?\
                 Is the supply of Indian workers increasing or decreasing?\
                 Which is shifting at a faster rateâ€”demand or supply?\
                 Provide reasoning and examples to support your explanation.")
