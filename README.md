Environment Configuration

Create an .env file in the root directory of your project with the following structure:

juhe_financial_news_token = "YOUR JUHE FINANCIAL TOKEN (OPTIONAL)"
newsapi = "YOUR FINANCIAL NEWS TOKEN (OPTIONAL)"

Siliconflow_api_key = "YOUR SILICONFLOW TOKEN"

NEO4J_URI = "YOUR NEO4J URI"
NEO4J_USERNAME = "YOUR NEO4J USERNAME (USUALLY neo4j)"
NEO4J_PASSWORD = "YOUR NEO4J PASSWORD"

Notes:
juhe_financial_news_token and newsapi are optional and not strictly required.
Replace each placeholder with your actual credentials.
